# CAPTCHA Webpage

## Overview

This project is a simple webpage that displays a CAPTCHA image to users, with the functionality to refresh the CAPTCHA and verify if user input matches the CAPTCHA text. It provides feedback on the verification, indicating whether the user's input was correct or not. This can be used as a basic example of CAPTCHA implementation to protect forms from automated submissions.

## Setup

To set up this project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.**

   You can do this by double-clicking the file or opening it directly from your web browser.

No additional dependencies are required for this project, as it runs purely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Once you have opened `index.html` in a web browser, you will see the following:

- A CAPTCHA image displaying a sequence of characters.
- An input field where you can type the characters you see in the CAPTCHA.
- A "Refresh" button to generate a new CAPTCHA if the current one is unclear.
- A "Verify" button which checks if your input matches the CAPTCHA.

### Steps to use:

1. Look at the CAPTCHA image and carefully type the characters into the input field provided.
2. Click the "Verify" button.
3. Receive feedback:
   - "Correct!" if your input matches the CAPTCHA.
   - "Incorrect, try again!" if it does not match.
4. If needed, click the "Refresh" button to generate and display a new CAPTCHA.

## Code Explanation

The project contains a single HTML file, `index.html`, which implements the CAPTCHA functionality using basic web technologies.

- **HTML**: Structures the webpage elements â€” the CAPTCHA image, input field, and buttons.
- **CSS**: (Optional, if added): Styles the elements for better visual presentation.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for:
  - Displaying a CAPTCHA.
  - Refreshing the CAPTCHA when required.
  - Verifying the input against the CAPTCHA.
  - Providing feedback to the user.

Below is a simplified explanation of each component:

- **CAPTCHA Generation**:
  - Generates a random string of characters to display as an image.
  - Uses a simple algorithm to ensure randomness and difficulty for bots.

- **Verify Functionality**:
  - Retrieves user input and compares it to the CAPTCHA string.
  - Provides feedback on whether the input is correct.

- **Refresh Functionality**:
  - Allows the user to generate a new CAPTCHA string and display it as an image when the current CAPTCHA is not clear.
